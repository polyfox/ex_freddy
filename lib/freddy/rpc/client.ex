  Performs a RPC request and blocks until the response arrives.

  The `routing_key` parameter specifies the routing key for the message. The routing
  key is used by the RabbitMQ server to route a message from an exchange to worker
  queues or another exchanges.

  The `payload` parameter specifies the message content as an Erlang term. The payload
  is converted to binary string by the `c:encode_request/2` callback before sending it
  to server.

  ## Options

    * `:timeout` - if present, the client is allowed to wait given number of
      milliseconds for the response message from the server
    * `:headers` - message headers
    * `:persistent` - if set, uses persistent delivery mode

    * `:timestamp` - timestamp associated with this message (epoch time)
